Flex your JS muscles 💪🏋🏿.

A modern JavaScript coding exercise inspired by [Rebecca Murphey](https://rmurphey.com/about.html)'s [js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment).

## Getting Started

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Start in [`src/01-basics.js`](./src/01-basics.js) and write code in each function to make the tests pass. If needed you can view the tests in the [corresponding `.test.js` file](./src/01-basics.test.js) for more details.
